Important:

Make sure your PS4 is jailbroken and running HEN or custom firmware.

Always use Real-Debrid links if you want faster, uncapped downloads.

I am not responsible for any consequences from using these links.

I’ve created a GitHub README for your repository with the disclaimer and fpkgi instructions. You can use it as-is.
